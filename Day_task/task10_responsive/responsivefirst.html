			<h1>Biography  </h1>
			<p>Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam was born to a poor Tamil Muslim family. He lived with his 
			family in the temple city of Tamilnadu, Rameswaram, where his father, Jainulabdeen,
			had a boat and was an imam of a local mosque. At the same time, his mother, Ashiamma, 
			was a housewife. Kalam had four brothers and one sister in his family, from which he 
			was the youngest. Kalam's ancestors were wealthy traders and landowners and had vast 
			land and property tracts. But with time, their business of ferrying pilgrims and 
			trading groceries suffered huge losses due to the Pamban Bridge's opening. As a 
			result, Kalam's family had become inadequate and struggled hard to make a living. 
			At a tender age, Kalam had to sell newspapers to supplement his family income.</p>
			
			<h2> Education</h2>
			<p>Although Kalam had average grades in school, he was very hard working and had 
			an immense desire to learn. He spent a lot of time studying and had developed a 
			particular interest in mathematics. Kalam left Schwartz higher secondary school 
			after completing his early education and went to Saint Joseph's College, 
			Tiruchirapalli. From Saint Joseph's College, he graduated in physics in 1954. 
			He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering at Madras Institute 
			of Technology.</p>
